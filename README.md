# POKEAPI ![Pokebola](https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/px32/Pokebola.png "Pokebola")

In this project i use a Pokedex to show the info of a pokemon, searching by its nature. To get this info i use an API to bring the data from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co)


## Technologies

To build this app I used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) v18, CSS, and HTML.

<ul>
  <li>In your system console write </li>
  
  `git init`<br/>
  `git clone https://github.com/rifanaldio/Pokemon.git`

  <li>Then you will have to type the following command, depending on what you have installed, npm or yarn.</li>
  
  `npm install`<br/>
    or <br/>
  `yarn install`
  <li>and that's it! you can run it with the following command and view the application.</li>

  `npm start`
</ul>
