# POKEAPI ![Pokebola](https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/px32/Pokebola.png "Pokebola")

In this project we use a Pokedex to show the info of a pokemon, searching by its name. To get this info we use an API to bring the data from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co)


## Technologies

To build this app I used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) v18, CSS, and HTML.
